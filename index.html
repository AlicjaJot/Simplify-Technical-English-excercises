<H1>How to deal with the SME?</H1>

<H1>SME step by step</H1>

    <p><strong>SME? Sounds like some kind of serious illness. Fortunately, it's just an abbreviation for “subject-matter expert”. It's a person who is crucial in a technical writer's work. Making documentation involves interviews with a lot of people. The tech writer has to get to know the product very well. It's impossible to do it without help from SME. How to handle it, if he is unresponsive?</strong></p>

    <p>SME (subject-matter expert) is a person who has deep knowledge of a particular topic, function, process, machine, technology and so on. Technical writers develop manuals, documents, books with assistance from SME. SMEs help to convert information into a suitable form for the target audience, check written materials for technical accuracy and so on. Technical writers can not work without help of SME. This is an instruction for the technical writers. The instruction explains how to work with SME.</p>

<p>Our subject-matter expert is a very important person and mostly doesn't have time to clarify the obvious things. He also has his work to do and might not see the reason to help a poor technical writer. Of course, not every SME will be like that. I hope you will meet only very kind and helpful experts, with deep knowledge. But, if not… Check how to be a bit like a psychologist and deal with “the tough” ones.</p>

<p>Firstly, every SME is only a human being. Each of them can be busy, forget about you, or just have a bad day. Patience is a very helpful feature, and not only in work life. Be patient, but also firm. Don't hesitate to remind about yourself, if your SME forgot, that you had an appointment. What could be more helpful here is to <strong>set a deadline</strong> that will be suitable for both of you and <strong>briefly describe what you need to discuss.</strong></p>

    <H2>The power of communication skills</H2>

    <p>During my journalism studies, I did an internship in television. I had to work with a camera operator who did not respect me. He saw a young intern on his schedule and then just went out to take care of his private business instead of working with me. I had to deal with it. Quickly I noticed that he was not very popular in the firm. Every journalist treated him as an inferior manual worker who took poor pictures. And because of this, he actually took lousy pictures and disrespected me. Then I suddenly told him that the camera operators are the most important workers in every television because TV is based on image. He felt appreciated after many years of being disrespected. He began to work with me willingly, and everyone was surprised at how good pictures he was making.</p>

        <p>Let's say that the camera operator was my SME. I needed his help and his engagement.</p>

            <p>Try to <strong>get to know your expert</strong>. Find out if he prefers to talk on the phone or just send emails. Show him who you are outside of work. Tell him what you like, share cookies, and take him out for a nice lunch. A closer relationship promotes working together. He doesn't have time to clarify the obvious things, so don't ask about them. Be prepared.  And <strong>show your SME that helping you pays off for him</strong> because someday you will help him too or, thanks to your work, he won't have to write the documentation himself!</p>
